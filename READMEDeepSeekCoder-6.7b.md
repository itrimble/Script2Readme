# Sync-Brew.sh Script Documentation

## Overview 
The `sync-Brew.sh` script is designed to manage Homebrew packages using the Brewfile concept. It exports a specific path for the Homebrew Bundle (i.e., `/Users/ian/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Brewfile/Brewfile`) and then runs the command "brew bundle". 

## Requirements
To run this script, you will need to ensure that Homebrew is installed on your system. If it's not already installed, you can use the following commands in terminal:
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
## Usage 
To run this script, navigate to its location using Terminal and execute it with the command `./sync-Brew.sh`. Be sure that you have the necessary permissions to do so.

## What the Script Does 
1. The script sets an environment variable (HOMEBREW_BREWFILE) specifying the path of the Brewfile which contains a list of formulas and casks for Homebrew to install.
2. It then runs the `brew bundle` command, applying all changes specified in the Brewfile. This includes installing or upgrading packages as necessary. 

## Important Notes
- The script assumes that your current working directory is where the Brewfile resides.
- If you have any customizations to make in your Homebrew setup (like tap specific repositories), these should be included in the Brewfile for `brew bundle` to recognize and apply them correctly. 

## Disclaimer
While this script can greatly simplify managing your Homebrew packages, there is always a risk of introducing new dependencies or upgrading existing ones without fully understanding their implications. Always take adequate backups and consider consulting with others if you're unsure about any significant changes made to your system configuration.
