This script is written in bash and it's used to analyze a given input file using different models. The main steps include reading the user inputs, checking dependencies of necessary tools like `awk` or Python (optional), getting available models from an external source, selecting one model for analysis based on users preference then executing scripts with selected parameters by calling corresponding functions in separate shell script files which are named after respective function calls at runtime. The output is saved into CSV logs and JSON metrics along with the final execution time of each step respectively stored as detailed log reports (in markdown format)
