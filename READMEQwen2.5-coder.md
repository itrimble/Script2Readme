# sync-Brew.sh README

## Overview
The `sync-Brew.sh` script is designed to synchronize Homebrew packages with a specified Brewfile. It primarily uses the `brew` command-line tool, which is essential for managing and installing software on macOS systems using Homebrew.

## Requirements
1. **Homebrew**: The `brew` package manager must be installed on your system.
2. **Brewfile**: The script assumes the existence of a Brewfile located at `/Users/ian/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Brewfile/Brewfile`. This file contains a list of packages to install and their versions.

## Usage
To run the `sync-Brew.sh` script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Homebrew is installed on your system.
2. Place the Brewfile in the specified path: `/Users/ian/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Brewfile/Brewfile`.
3. Open a terminal window.
4. Navigate to the directory where `sync-Brew.sh` is located.
5. Execute the script by typing:
   ```bash
   ./sync-Brew.sh
   ```

## What the Script Does
The script performs the following operations:

1. **Set Environment Variable**: The script sets the `HOMEBREW_BREWFILE` environment variable to the location of the Brewfile.
2. **Run Brew Bundle**: It then uses the `brew bundle install` command to install all packages specified in the Brewfile, ensuring they are up-to-date and match the versions listed.

## Important Notes
- This script will modify your system's Homebrew installation based on the contents of the specified Brewfile.
- Ensure that the Brewfile contains accurate package specifications to avoid installing incorrect or outdated software.

## Disclaimer
Running this script may have unintended consequences, including but not limited to:
- Installing or upgrading packages that are essential for system stability.
- Removing or altering existing packages without your knowledge.
- Potential conflicts with other software installed on your system.

Please review the Brewfile and understand its contents before running the script. Proceed with caution and make sure you have a backup of your current Homebrew configuration if necessary.
