 This is a shell script that analyzes the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) models on input text. The script has several features, including:

1. Dependency checking: The script checks if the necessary dependencies are installed on the system before proceeding with the analysis.
2. Input validation: The script validates the input file and checks that it is a text file.
3. Model selection: The script allows users to select one of several NLP models available, such as spaCy or Gensim.
4. Analysis: The script analyzes the input text using the selected model and generates a report on its performance.
5. Benchmarking: The script generates benchmarking data for each analysis, including metrics such as processing time and memory usage.
6. Logging: The script logs various events and data to CSV and JSON files for later analysis or reference.

The script also includes several functions, such as `check_dependencies()`, `get_system_info()`, `select_model()`, `validate_input_file()`, `analyze_script()`, and `log_benchmark()`. These functions serve as building blocks for the overall functionality of the script.
