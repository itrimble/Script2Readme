Overview
--------

This script, `sync-Brew.sh`, is a shell script that automates the process of updating homebrew formulas and casks using a Brewfile. The script assumes that the user has already installed and configured Homebrew on their system.

Requirements
------------

To run this script, you will need to have Homebrew installed on your system. You can install Homebrew by running the command `brew --version` in your terminal window. If Homebrew is not installed, you can download it from the official Homebrew website.

Once you have Homebrew installed, you will need to create a Brewfile in your home directory (e.g., `/Users/ian/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Brewfile/Brewfile`). This file should contain the list of formulae and casks that you want to install or update.

Usage
-----

To run this script, simply open your terminal window and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, type `./sync-Brew.sh` and press enter. The script will automatically execute the `brew bundle` command with the Brewfile specified in the environment variable `HOMEBREW_BREWFILE`.

What the Script Does
------------------

The `sync-Brew.sh` script performs the following actions:

1. Sets the environment variable `HOMEBREW_BREWFILE` to point to the Brewfile in your home directory.
2. Executes the `brew bundle` command with the `--global` option, which installs or updates all formulae and casks specified in the Brewfile.
3. If any formulae or casks are not installed or are outdated, the script will prompt you to confirm whether to proceed with the installation or update.
4. Once the installation or update is complete, the script displays a summary of the changes made to your Homebrew environment.

Important Notes
--------------

* The `sync-Brew.sh` script assumes that the user has already installed and configured Homebrew on their system. If Homebrew is not installed or configured correctly, the script may not function properly.
* The script uses the `--global` option with the `brew bundle` command to update all formulae and casks in your Brewfile. This means that the script will update any formulae or casks that are currently installed on your system, regardless of whether they are specified in your Brewfile.
* If you have a large number of formulae or casks in your Brewfile, the `sync-Brew.sh` script may take some time to complete. Be patient and allow the script to run its course.

Disclaimer
----------

* The use of this script is at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage or issues that may arise from running the script on your system. Before running the script, please ensure that you have a backup of your Homebrew environment and that you understand how the script works.
* The `sync-Brew.sh` script is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. Use at your own risk.
