# Quality of Life Features for Documentation Generation

Beyond the time estimation and benchmarking I've already added, here are additional features that would significantly improve the experience for coders creating documentation:

## 1. Template Support
```bash
--template custom-template.md   # Use custom documentation template
--templates-dir ~/.doc-templates # Store reusable templates
```
This would allow teams to maintain consistent documentation styles across projects.

## 2. Batch Processing
```bash
./script2readme.sh --batch src/*.sh   # Process multiple files
./script2readme.sh --recursive src/   # Process an entire directory
```
Perfect for documenting an entire codebase in one command.

## 3. Documentation Preview
```bash
--preview   # Opens generated README in Markdown preview
--live      # Live preview that updates as documentation is generated
```
This would let users immediately see how their documentation looks.

## 4. Smart Updates
```bash
--update   # Only update sections that have changed in code
--keep-custom  # Preserve manually written sections
```
This prevents losing manual edits when regenerating documentation.

## 5. Version Control Integration
```bash
--commit "Updated documentation"  # Automatically commit changes
--branch docs-update             # Create a branch for documentation
```
Streamlines the documentation workflow with Git.

## 6. Code Coverage Analysis
```bash
--coverage  # Analyze which functions/methods are documented
--missing   # Report undocumented components
```
Helps ensure comprehensive documentation.

## 7. Interactive Mode
```bash
--interactive  # Step through each section and allow manual edits
```
For fine-tuning the AI-generated content interactively.

## 8. Project Configuration
```bash
--init     # Create a .script2readme.yml config file
--project  # Use project-specific settings
```
Saves preferences and settings per project.

## 9. Example Generation
```bash
--examples   # Generate usage examples for each function
--test-code  # Create runnable test code from examples
```
Creates practical examples showing how to use the code.

## 10. Documentation Export
```bash
--export html  # Export to various formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
--publish      # Publish to GitHub Pages or documentation site
```
Makes sharing documentation easier.

These features would transform the tool from a simple script analyzer into a comprehensive documentation platform that fits seamlessly into a developer's workflow.
