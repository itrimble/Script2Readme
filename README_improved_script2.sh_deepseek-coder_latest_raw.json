It was designed to perform various tasks such as analyzing the performance of software programs or running tests. The main purpose for this program is processing command-line arguments while creating an overview section with information about what each part does, its inputs and outputs, versioning features etc., in a markdown formatted text file (as requested).\n\nHere's how it works: \n1) It starts by defining various global variables such as system specifications like OS type or the name of your program. This section is used to ensure that other parts of script do not get affected when run individually, and thus avoid any unexpected behavior caused due unset environment data for these specific tasks (like getting user information). \n2) It then checks command line arguments if they exist by looking at '$1', '$2' etc. If none are provided it will print an error message to the console asking users what their script should do next, like running with `--help` option for further usage instructions or providing a specific input file as argument (like \"example_input\").\n3) The rest of sections in this shell scripte showcase different features such as:  overview section explaining how it works; requirements describing the dependencies and prerequisites, usages details on using examples to help users understand what they need or already know about before running a particular script. How-it-works providing detailed explanation for each command in order of operation (steps), configuration options being configurable etc.; troubleshooting containing common issues with their solutions; requirements stating all the required dependencies and prerequisites, output details to guide users on what they need from this tool or how it should be used.\n4) It also provides markdown formatted text in a file named \"README\" which contains various sections explaining each part of script's functionality with their respective inputs/outputs etc., including versioning features and common usage examples, all the required dependencies to run specific commands included as well user guide details for new users.\n5) At last it ends by logging execution time together in a file named \"benchmark_log\" along side JSON metrics log of how long each step took if any was involved (which are also explained at overview section). It provides final timestamp and total script run-time summary as well guide user on where to find these logs.\n"},"done_reason":"stop","done":true,"total_duration":9305859709,"load_duration":11277334,"prompt_eval_count":2048,"prompt_eval_duration":2063991541,"eval_count":499,"eval_duration":7201960875}
